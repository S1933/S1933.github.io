# Copilot Instructions for S1933.github.io

This repository contains a GitHub Pages website with static HTML files.

## Project Overview

- This is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages
- The site uses plain HTML without any build process or framework
- The main entry point is `index.html`

## Coding Guidelines

### HTML Files

- Use valid HTML5 syntax with proper doctype declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`)
- Include appropriate meta tags for charset (`UTF-8`) and viewport settings
- Keep HTML files well-structured with proper indentation
- Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`)

### File Naming

- Use lowercase letters for file names
- Use hyphens (`-`) to separate words in file names (e.g., `about-us.html`)
- Keep file names descriptive and concise

### Best Practices

- Ensure all HTML files are properly formatted and indented
- Add descriptive `<title>` tags to all pages
- Include alt attributes for all images
- Test pages in a browser before committing changes
- Keep the codebase simple and maintainable

## Testing

Since this is a static HTML website, verify changes by:

1. Using a local server for accurate testing (e.g., `python -m http.server` or VS Code Live Server extension)
2. Checking for valid HTML syntax
3. Ensuring all links work correctly
4. Testing responsive behavior on different screen sizes
